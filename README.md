# TurkeyRun

This is a Thanksgiving Day passion programming project.

The game works like this:

Turkey and pumpkin pie will be falling out of the sky. Your
job is to catch. That's all there is to it.

Well... As Billy Mays would say, BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!!

I assume you're not gonna catch every single thing that falls
out of the sky. Yes you're gonna miss some, but you can only
miss up to a certain amount. You are allowed to miss up to 20
points worth of food.

Turkey is worth 3 points
Pie is worth 1 point

Apparently, poop also falls out of the sky, and it ain't fun
catching one of these. You catch one, you lose automatically.

You play as a basket, and your job is to catch as much food as
you can to rack up points without missing too many or catching
a piece of poop.
